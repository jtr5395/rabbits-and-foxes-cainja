This is no longer necessary

For this code to work, CythonMaybe needs to be converted into a module.

To do this:
1. Make sure the setup.py file looks like this:
from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize

setup(
    ext_modules=cythonize("CythonMaybe.pyx"),
)

2. In the terminal, type:
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

This will convert CythonMaybe

3. Run rabbits-and-foxes.py normally
