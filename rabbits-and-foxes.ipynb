    "Let's step back for a moment. Suppose we have a first-order ODE $u'=f(u)$. You know that if we were to integrate this, there would be an arbitrary constant of integration. To find its value, we do need to know one point on the curve $(t, u)$. When the derivative in the ODE is with respect to time, we call that point the _initial value_ and write something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u(t=0)=u_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a second-order ODE, we already saw how to write it as a system of first-order ODEs, and we would need an initial value for each equation: two conditions are needed to determine our constants of integration. The same applies for higher-order ODEs: if it is of order $n$, we can write it as $n$ first-order equations, and we need $n$ known values. If we have that data, we call the problem an _initial value problem_.\n",

    "Remember the definition of a derivative? The derivative represents the slope of the tangent at a point of the curve $u=u(t)$, and the definition of the derivative $u'$ for a function is:\n",

    "With this equation, and because we know $u'(t)=f(u)$, if we have an initial value, we can step by $\\Delta t$ and find the value of $u(t+\\Delta t)$, then we can take this value, and find $u(t+2\\Delta t)$, and so on: we say that we _step in time_, numerically finding the solution $u(t)$ for a range of values: $t_1, t_2, t_3 \\cdots$, each separated by $\\Delta t$. The numerical solution of the ODE is simply the table of values $t_i, u_i$ that results from this process.\n"
